Platform Engineering & Enablement
• Platformized backup automations & self-service enablement
• Unified backup observability (Cohesity + Dynatrace + Splunk reporting)
• Re-usable PowerShell / REST modules and templates for standard backup jobs

Operational Excellence
• End-to-end backup SLO monitoring (RPO/RTO dashboards & alerting)
• Failed-job triage automation using “consecutive failures without success” logic
• ServiceNow integration to auto-create incidents/tasks from critical backup alerts and failures

40% Objective – Enabling Other Teams
• “Backup readiness” onboarding kit for new applications (checklists & job templates)
• DBA self-service refresh / restore using Cohesity clones and views
• ServiceNow request items for new backup jobs, restores and DB refreshes (auto-routed to backup team)

People Transformation
• Backup & recovery skill matrix with quarterly upskilling goals
• Internal mini-bootcamps (Cohesity, SQL/Oracle backup, Nutanix, backup architecture)
• Automation champions program – each team member owns a script, dashboard or workflow

Strategic Initiatives
• Recovery & DR playbook (immutable copies, clean-room restores, regular drills)
• Standardized DR tests for critical applications (documented scenarios & success criteria)
• Backup platform roadmap (Cohesity feature adoption, agent upgrades, legacy tech exit)

Risk, Compliance & Governance
• Backup policy compliance reports (unprotected assets, RPO/RTO breaches)
• Audit-ready evidence packs for SOC/ISO (scheduled backup & restore reports)
• Immutable / air-gapped copy coverage and periodic restore-drill results for Tier-0/Tier-1 apps
