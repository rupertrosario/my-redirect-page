Subject: MTTR clarification: legacy unassigned ticket picked up during workflow testing

Hi Team,

Providing context on the MTTR timeline for this ticket.

The ticket was created on **2024-01-04** by a **Control-M batch job** (requestor/user: **Splunk user**) and remained **unassigned (no owner / no team)** until **2025-12-18**, when my **Dynatrace workflow** (being tested for auto-creating/auto-routing backup failure incidents to our team) inadvertently picked up this legacy ticket and routed it to our queue. I assigned it to myself as part of the testing/validation.

I had the ticket for ~5 days because I kept it **on hold while coordinating with the ARE team** to confirm the root cause (workflow logic picking up legacy unassigned tickets) and to implement the fix, so we didn’t close it prematurely while the correction was still in progress.

Once the workflow correction was completed and the ticket was confirmed as an unintended pickup, I closed it because it was a **legacy unassigned ticket (from Jan 2024)** incorrectly routed by the test workflow, and there was **no valid team/owner to reassign it to**.

**Preventive action (completed):** The workflow logic is now corrected so stale/unassigned legacy tickets cannot be picked up by the Dynatrace workflow going forward.

Thanks,
R R
