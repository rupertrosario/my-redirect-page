Our team was assigned this ticket on 2025-12-18, and I assigned it to myself as part of testing. The Dynatrace workflow I was testing (auto-creation/auto-routing of backup failure incidents to our team) inadvertently picked up this legacy unassigned ticket and routed it to our queue.

The ticket was originally created on 2024-01-04 by a Control-M batch job (requestor/user: Splunk user) and was not created by our team/process.

I kept it for ~5 days on hold while coordinating with ARE to confirm the issue and apply the workflow fix. Once the fix was completed and it was confirmed as an unintended pickup, I closed it since it was a legacy unassigned ticket and there was no valid team/owner to reassign it to.

Preventive action completed: Workflow updated so stale/unassigned legacy tickets can’t be picked up going forward.
