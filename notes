Automate a near-real-time Dynatrace workflow (scheduled) that polls Cohesity via API to correlate network alerts with current interface status and create/update separate incidents for our team and the relevant data center teams.


Done

Built scheduled Dynatrace workflow logic + working JS to pull Cohesity 1105 alerts per cluster and confirm current interface-down via /public/interface.

Pending

Add DC1/DC2 routing and create/update separate incidents (our team + DC teams) with dedup/correlation rules.
