Automate a near-real-time Dynatrace workflow (scheduled) that polls Cohesity via API to correlate network alerts with current interface status and create/update separate incidents for our team and the relevant data center teams.


Done

Built scheduled Dynatrace workflow logic + working JS to pull Cohesity 1105 alerts per cluster and confirm current interface-down via /public/interface.

Pending

Add DC1/DC2 routing and create/update separate incidents (our team + DC teams) with dedup/correlation rules.



Scheduled Dynatrace workflow to poll Cohesity backup failures via API, validate “failed with no later success,” and auto-create/update incidents for the relevant support teams.


Done

Scheduled Dynatrace workflow and Cohesity API logic implemented and working end-to-end (detection + validation + ticket trigger).

Pending

Incident description/details not populating correctly during create (update works/expected) — Jira raised with ARE team to fix incident payload/field mapping.


One consolidated incident per day covering the last 24 hours (18:00–18:00 IST)

Failures only are included (no success entries)

Consolidation reduces duplicate/parallel tickets and keeps daily triage in one place

Our team no longer needs to create or routine-update incidents for tracking—so we can focus on resolving issues faster
